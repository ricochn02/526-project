    "## Introduction\n",
    "Union membership rates have also declined in the past several decades, both in the United States and Canada *(ECON 460 slide)*. *Briefly write some more big picture union history in North America stuff.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In his seminal paper on unions, Hirschman (1970) suggests that workers dissatisfied with their current working conditions can choose one of two actions. First, they may “exit”, meaning that they simply resign and seek another job. Second, they may use their “voice”, staying at their job to demand better conditions. He postulates that unions enable workers to use their voice by providing collective bargaining, and grievance and arbitration systems. Freeman (1980) investigates this notion further, finding that union membership is positively associated with years spent at the same company and negatively associated with quitting behaviour or being fired. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Briefly talk about the history of laws essentially prohibiting unions in the United States, right to work laws etc. Apparently, Act 10 technically isn’t a RTW law but even broader/more stringent?*\n",
    "\n",
    "U.S. labour unions gained strong legal protections with the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, but later laws and policy developments steadily reduced their power. The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act) weakened key union tactics by restricting secondary boycotts and jurisdictional strikes, and authorizing states to enact Right-to-Work (RTW) laws that prohibit union security agreements and undermine the unions’ ability to collect membership fees for all covered workers [1], [2]. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the Taft-Hartley Act marked a shift toward a legal outcome less favorable to unions, and subsequent measures, such as the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, further increased federal oversight of internal union affairs and limited certain forms of picketing. [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "*Short transitional paragraph/sentence connecting public unions to teachers. Three common strategies to weaken teacher unions are by introducing policies that preclude collective bargaining, agency fees (i.e., the collection of union membership fees), and strikes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "An especially notable example of such policies was Act 10, a Wisconsin state law first introduced in 2011 under former Republican governor Scott Walker. Act 10 dictated how state government employees, including teachers and nurses, could use their “voice” to bargain over work pay and conditions (PBS Wisconsin). Among the changes included restrictions to what unions could negotiate beyond wages and the impediment of member fee collections, all of which worked to undermine the survival of public sector unions (WPR). The enactment proved to be controversial, triggering weeks of large protests, a walkout of Democratic senators, numerous legal challenges, and even recall elections seeking to unseat then Governor Walker. However, supporters argued that before the act, the previous labour market for public employees was inefficient and diverted proper spending in school districts and local governments (PBS Wisconsin). As of writing this report, attempts to repeal the law are still playing out in the courts more than a decade after it took effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are particularly interested in the effect of policies that weaken public-sector collective bargaining rights on teacher compensation.\n",
    "Thus, our research question is, “How do laws obstructing public employee unions affect teacher wages?” More specifically, we assess how the 2011 Wisconsin Act 10 impacted salaries for elementary and secondary public school teachers. We hypothesize that by impeding the collective bargaining power of public employees, Act 10 reduced teacher salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31 (2018) is a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that states and public sector unions may no longer collect “agency” or “fair-share” fees from non-consenting employees, on the ground that such compelled payments violate the First Amendment, thereby overruling Abood v. Detroit Board of Education (1997) [4]. Since public sector unions remain legally obligated to represent all workers in a bargaining unit, including non-members, the ruling removes a major, previously stable revenue source while preserving the duty of fair representation, creating strong free rider incentives. Policy analyses, therefore, describe Janus as a significant constraint on public sector union power, limiting unions’ financial resources, their capacity to bargain and litigate effectively, and their prospects for future membership growth [5], [6]."

    "### Literature Review\n",
    "The effect of unions remains a contentious topic. On one hand, the collective power of unions helps to give workers a seat at the table. On the other hand, unions are said to inefficiently sustain high wages and prevent poor-performing workers from being fired. Furthermore, both its proponents and detractors claim that unions have an impact on productivity. \n",

    "## Data\n",
    "We obtained data from two sources. First is the Correlates of State Policy Project (CSPP) from the University of Michigan. It is a comprehensive state-level panel dataset containing a diverse range of policy indicator variables and outcomes such as education, healthcare, environment, and criminal justice. This dataset is assembled by compiling data from a plethora of different existing studies. The specific data that we use from the CSPP describes the timing of policies prohibiting agency fees for different states. Since we eventually narrowed our research scope to focus only on Wisconsin being treated, this dataset was not needed. Nevertheless, we mention it in this report because of its value and potential for future research. Second is a table on average teacher salaries by state from 1990 to 2020, obtained from the National Science Board (NSB). Their data was assembled using estimates from the National Education Association (NEA). We merged the two datasets by state and year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis particularly used data from the CSPP dataset in the time period of 1990 to 2017 for the following states: Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. For a robustness check later in the paper, we use data for Michigan in the same time period.\n"

However, the number of observations for each state in the time period 1990-2017 is 28. With such a small sample size, the standard errors may not be well defined. Therefore, we use a synthetic control for our analysis. The treated unit is Wisconsin, and the donor pool consists of all the other states from the list in the “Data” section. The donor pool states never implemented the RTW or any similar policy within or prior to the time period being analyzed. We will combine the untreated states to build a fake state that closely resembles the pre-treatment trend of Wisconsin. We’ll see how the synthetic control behaves after the intervention.\n",

Also assume that the data we have span $T$ time periods, with $T_0$ periods before the intervention. For each unit $j$ and each time $t$, we observe the outcome $Y_{jt}$.
